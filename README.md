# What is this ?

Something...

You may deploy the components as you see fit (as Home page like below, on Record pages etc.), but this is how it looks like for me:

## Custom objects

There are three custom objects defined: Link__c, Tag__c and TagAssociaion__c. Metadata is in.

## Where can it run ?
So it obviously depends on the amount of links and tags you populate. I personally just run in a Trailhead Playground and I still have plenty of space left in the 5 MB included.

## Okay to fork ?

Sure, give it a go. Please do not hesitate to drop me pull-requests or raise an issue, if you find issues or have a good idea for enhancement.
